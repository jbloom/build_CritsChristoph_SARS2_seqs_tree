# Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed by Crits-Christoph et al (2024)
This interactive phylogeny shows a tree of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed in [Crits-Christoph et al, Cell (2024)](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00901-2).
Because that paper does not provide details on how it generated the phylogeny shown in the paper (eg, Figure 1A), this phylogeny may not exactly match that one.

Note that the best way to root the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is still an open topic with substantial uncertainty (see [Pipes et al (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993)).
There are also open questions about the best way to subsample, de-duplicate, and quality control early SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Further, the high similarity of the sequences mean there is also just limited statistical support to reliably draw conclusions about some aspects of the phylogeny (see the [paper "Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult" by Morel et al (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/5/1777/6030946)).
However, further work on rooting and sequence curation are needed (this phylogeny should help with that), and 
So recall the conclusion of [Pipes et al (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993) that _"These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence."_

The code used to build this phylogeny is available [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbloom/build_CritsChristoph_SARS2_seqs_tree).
